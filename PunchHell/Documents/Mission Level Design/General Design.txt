Moving camera that keeps the player moving with it when no buttons are pressed

Player cannot move outside of the camera bounds

CameraSpeed: 5

CameraDirection: Upwards

Enemy Spawnpoints:
Top of the screen at one of 17 evenly distributed locations (hidden to the player)

Despawn points:
After projectiles, enemies, etc leave the screen going left, right, or downwards, they should despawn. They are not trapped within the bounds of the camera.

Activate transition into/out of dialogue scenes after duration of the mission is over or boss is defeated.

Example for a 2 min mission, if player is not dead, play the mission success screen.
HOWEVER for a boss fight mission, the mission only ends after the boss is defeated
	NOTE: The exception to this is when there is a tutorial segment within the mission explaining something.

Example:
	timer == 0.00
	"Hi, welcome to..." Press A to continue
	"Here is the health" press A to continue
	"This is the ___ ability" Press A to continue
	"good luck" Press A to continue.
Timer should still be 0.00. Mission has not started yet since tutorial time is not included.
