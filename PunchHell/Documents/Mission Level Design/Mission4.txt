TIME TO GET CHAOTIC HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

For 120 seconds, spawn units. Start slow.
Units should have double the health and deal double the damage. Projectiles should be red and enemies should have a red tint to them.

Only basics for the first 21 seconds. random amounts from 10-15 every 7 seconds

Basics and tridents next. random amounts from 5-10 every 5 seconds.

Throw everything. Every second something should spawn at a random location. This goes on for 120 seconds.

Suddenly have a calm. No more enemies spawn. The music should change. 10 seconds of tension, and then the boss spawns.

The boss will slowly move into the screen.
The boss healthbar and name should be at the top of the screen much like in Souls-like games
The mission only ends after the boss has been killed and the explosion animation finishes.
Victory screen should direct the player elsewhere
