MISSION STARTS
Start the timer.
Mission length = 120 seconds
Basic enemy time interval (time to spawn and despawn enemy when they leave the screen): 7
Trident enemy time interval (time to spawn and despawn enemy when they leave the screen): 7
Homing enemy time interval (time to spawn and despawn enemy when they leave the screen): 7
Laser enemy time interval (time to spawn and despawn enemy when they leave the screen): 7
Bomber enemy time interval (time to spawn and despawn enemy when they leave the screen): 7


Spawn 3 laser enemies at left, right, and middle of the screen.

After enough time has passed where they could leave the screen (regardless if they are destroyed), spawn 3 Bombers at the same locations

Spawn laser units at locations 1-5, 7-12, 14-17 with bombers between them. The ideal is that the player should feel the fear of god unless they blow up all those units using the bombers.

Spawn a random mix of 5 enemies at once. Increase enemy count by 1 for every 10 seconds that pass.
After 120 seconds, show victory screen. If the player dies, show the death screen.
